# 1.0 (18-10-2020)
### Release Highlights
Version 1.0 is the first release of my web scraper. At this stage, it is just a simple web scraper that takes in a search item and return the first 40 results, with their names and prices, and outputs them into the console. Printing to console was done so that it is optimized to be used on Linux machines or CLIs with no GUIs.
